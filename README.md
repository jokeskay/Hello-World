# Hello-World
I don't know how to use a computer
I found out how to use a computer and start to look at it like battling with a very smart person
Found out how to use the internet and disvovered the world of online gaming and asteroids
Spent years gathering little by little more knowledge on how to use the internet for file storage and using applications
Found more applications and was able to learn how to use them
Bought a laptop
Used this laptop more and started to really like it, appreciating how far technology has came from when I learned how to use a computer
Found github.
Now want to create small projects and hopefully get really good at programming small projects, and one day create something big
